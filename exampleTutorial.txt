This is an example file for the Python tutorial generator.

Creating variables in Python is easy. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to include variable types in declarations. Try this:

>>> name = 'Guido van Rossum'
>>> age = 58
>>> programmer = True

You can manipulate integers like you would in any language (note that things to the right of number signs are comments, so you can ignore them):

>>> x = 3 + 5 * (4 - 2)  # x is now 13

And the Python interpreter will evaluate expressions and print the value:

>>> x + 3
>>> not programmer

You can even append to strings with arithmetic operators!

>>> accolade = name + ' invented Python.'
>>> print(accolade)

Python is a very high-level language, and, while it is somewhat slower than
languages like C++ or even Java, advances in hardware are making that gap
smaller and smaller.
